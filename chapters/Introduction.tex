\section{What is UCC}
	UCC is a club dedicated to the social and technical side of computers. As of this year, we'll have been around on campus in one form or another for 43 years.\\
	We have computers for member use, the cheapest drink machine on campas (93c for a coke), internet, and all the tools one might need for hacking a project together.\\
