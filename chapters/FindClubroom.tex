% Directions to the clubroom, ideally with non terrible maps. Most people don't ever find it :-(

\section{Directions}
	The most popular to find UCC is to first find the UWA Tavern, follow the fence on the outside until you find the staircase at the back. Go up the stairs to the top and walk forward to find UCC. The two maps below should give you a general fiew on where to go. Of course you can always ask a member on help to get here.
