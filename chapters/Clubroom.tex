\chapter{UCC::Clubroom}

\null
The clubroom is usually open from about 9am until 11pm throughout the semester. It is also sometimes open on weekends, and most days during university holidays. If you want to check the clubroom is open and who is there, check out \url{http://webcam.ucc.asn.au}

Within the clubroom there are a bunch desktop machines, tons of books, couches, a server room, and many people with a wide array of knowledge. We encourage our members to use them as they see fit.

We don't have cleaners, so we rely on our members to look after the clubroom. There is always a door-holder in the room if it's open. Of course, if you see something that needs doing such as cleaning up, feel free to do it!
