\zchapter{Your Account}

Signing up on O-Day (Or in general) does not give you an account instantly. To get an account, you will need to go to the clubroom!

Once you get to the clubroom, someone will be able to help you make your account. Simply tell someone that you need a new account and they'll run it through with you. You'll need your campass card with a 2017 UCC Membership sticker. Alternately, you can sign up at the clubroom.

Your account gives you access to all things UCC. You will gain access to a UCC-hosted email address \url{ACCOUNT@ucc.asn.au}, a webspace at \url{http://ACCOUNT.ucc.asn.au}, the vending machines, and many more services. The person who signs you up will be able to show you how all these things work.

If you need to add money to your UCC account, you'll need to ask for someone on the "Door Group" (Formally Coke). They will be able to put money onto your UCC account for you. \textbf{First-time members get \$5 free credit!} You can then use this credit for everything from the Drink \& snack machines, to payment of UCC hosted events.
